## Morning Work

### Example function with indentation

function greet(){
    console.log('Hello builders!');
}
greet();

### Loops - Arrays

* while loop

let count = 0;
while (count <= 100) {
    // do a thing
    count ++;
}

const - immutable
let - mutable
var - mutable

for (let count = 0; count <= 100; count++) {
    // do some things
}

* Usually working with an array in JS
